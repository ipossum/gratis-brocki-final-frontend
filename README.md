# GratisBrocki

A website that can be used freely to share or to give away all kinds of goods for free. Some of the main goals behind the project are as follows:
* to make sustainable resource use easier
* to help transition to a minimalist lifestyle
* to facilitate giving and sharing without financial motives
* to create a free and simple, but effective website

GratisBrocki was developed as part of a student project on object-oriented programming.
We hope you enjoy it. We did :-)

## Installation

Use Project from Version Control in your IntelliJ Idea.
Just copy the link from git and paste it into Idea.

## Usage

There are different ways to use this application. However, you will need the backend to make it work properly.
You will find it [here](https://github.com/ipossum/gratis-brocki-backend)

## Contributing

* Fork it!
* Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b fb-description`
* Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
* Push to the branch: `git push origin fb-description`
* Submit a pull request!

## Description/Documentation

The frontend requires a working backend. The backend accesses an H2 database. The database holds data about users,
items, pictures and messages. By this stage User, Item and Picture are implemented in
the code and can be manipulated via the API.

## Functionality

The following functionality is implemented in the frontend:

* Show all items

* Show item details

* Update item

* Create item

* Signup (create user)

* Update user



## Caution!

This version of the application is for testing purposes only. Some components such as authentication and picture upload are
yet to be implemented. This should be extended in the near future, so that "GratisBrocki" can offer its services to the public.
